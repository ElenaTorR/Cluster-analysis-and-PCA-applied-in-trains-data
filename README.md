# Cluster analysis and PCA applied in trains data

The following notebook shows an alternative application of cluster analysis and PCA. The main goal is find a way for classify two kind of wheel damages (RCF and wheel flat) and understand which variableas are more useful for a clear classification.

Hear the main steps followed:

- Upload datasets with RCF and flats test cases and filter them
- Datasets transformations for obtain the final dataset use for the analysis
- Index time sereis visualization
- Define test and train test for doing analysis and validate them
- Cluster analysis
- PCA and component visualization
- SVM
- logistic regression
